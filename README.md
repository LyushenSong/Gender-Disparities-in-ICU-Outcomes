# Gender-Disparities-in-ICU-Outcomes
Using the MIMIC-IV database (8,178 ICU patients), one-year mortality outcomes were similar across genders. However, women had higher 28-day mortality in propensity-matched analyses [HR 1.13 (95% CI 1.05â€“1.22)]. No significant gender differences were found by age or diagnosis, highlighting the need to explore gender-specific ICU factors.
